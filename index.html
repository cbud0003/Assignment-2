            <p> The Olympic Games are an international sporting event, held every four years. The ultimate aims are to nurture human beings and contribute to world peace via sport. 
                Summer and winter games are held at separate times. (About The Olympic Games, n.d.)
                The first Olympic Games was first held in Athens, Greece in 1986, where athletes consist of all males (Athens 1896 Olympic Games, n.d.). 
                Female competed for the first time at the 1900 Games that was held in Paris (When Did Women First Compete in the Olympic Games, 2021).
                In research from The Guardian (2017), more than 35,000 medals have been awarded at the Olympics since 1896. 
                This visualization aims to explore more about which athletes have won the most medals and which country do they came from and 
                how has it changed over time. <br>

                <h2>Men vs Women</h2>
                <p class="">
                   At first glance, the participants have largely been men over the years. The first ever female particpants 
                   recorded was in <b>1900</b> with a total of <b>11</b> participants, the number gradually increases over the years. Meanwhile,
                   the male participants can be seen consistent over the years, with <b>1,255</b> participants as the highest ever recorded 
                   in <b>1920</b> and lowest was in 1896 - only <b>151</b> in total.
                   As for the female, the highest recorded number of participants is <b>932</b> in <b>2008</b>. <br>
                   A trend that can be seen in this graph is that <b>male participants are consistently higher than female participants</b>,
                   eventhough there has been an increase in female participants since 1900, the male participants are seemingly always higher and
                   never once recorded lower than the female participants.

                     Naturally, as the number of participants increase, so does the number of medals. 
                     It started with only <b>151</b> medals in <b>1896</b> to a total of <b>1,949</b> medals in <b>2012</b>. 
                     There are no particular trends in which medal type is awarded most as it keeps on changing every year. For example, 
                     in year <b>1928</b>, <b>Bronze</b> is the highest medal type awarded but in <b>1932</b>, the highest is <b>Gold</b>.
                     However,the accumulated number of medals from year 1896 - 2012 is <b>31,165</b>, with <b>Gold</b> as the leading medal type 
                     - a total number of <b>10,486 </b>, followed by <b>Bronze (10,369)</b> and <b>Silver (10,310)</b>.
